On April 7 a serious security vulnerability ([CVE-2014-0160][2]) was disclosed in the OpenSSL library. Like much of the internet, we responded to this critical issue by conducting a security review of our servers. The result of that review is as follows:

## Koding is unaffected by the security vulnerability known as Heartbleed.

**The primary reason for this is that we've never used the OpenSSL library** and so as a result, are unaffected. Koding built its own proxies using [Go][3] and Go has its own [implementation of TLS][4]. Therefore, you don't need to change your password (unless you used the same password on other sites that [have been affected][5] by Heartbleed).

We did a **thorough investigation** anyway and we've concluded that none of our servers were affected by this bug, nor was any user information compromised. However, that being said, our engineering team will **continue to monitor the situation** and share updates as they become available.

At Koding **we take security and transparency seriously**, which is why we want to let you know **your information is safe**. No additional step is required on your behalf. If you have any questions feel free to email us at [support@koding.com][6]

See you on [Koding][7]! :)
