Now through Dec 3rd (2300 PST), if you buy a **yearly subscription** <!--more--> for any [Koding plan][6], we will automatically refund you **50% of the total within 24 hours** of signup! Sure, you can get toys and clothes and other goodies, but a _gift of Kode_ is just so cool! Get them (or yourself) introduced to software development the right way... through Koding!

Thanksgiving does not get any nerdier :)
