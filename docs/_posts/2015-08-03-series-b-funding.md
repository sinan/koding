Today, we're excited to announce that we've closed $10 million in Series B funding <!--more--> led by [Khosla Ventures][2] with participation from [500 Startups][3] and our existing investors, [Matrix Partners][4] and [RTP Ventures][5]. As part of this round of financing, Khosla Venture's newest partner, Ari Zilka, will join Koding's board of directors. Ari has a long and [distinguished career][6] in Silicon Valley: most recently, he was the CTO of Hortonworks and previously founded and served as the CTO of Terracotta. We're thrilled to have Ari's guidance and expertise in enterprise and cloud computing as we continue to execute on our vision to make cloud-based software development more accessible and infinitely scalable.

We are now also opening up signups for early access to our newest product, [Koding for Teams][7], which eliminates the pain points typically experienced by both large and small software development organizations. While individual engineering skills still matter a lot, it's the collective effort of a team that really gets a product built. With Koding for Teams, you can easily engage in tasks like remote interviewing, effortless on-boarding of new team members in minutes, collaborating in real time without messy installs and building internal communities. Our Teams product will make your software development more efficient and productive.

Along with companies, Koding for Teams will be extremely valuable to schools and universities worldwide as the usage patterns of students and academic software teams are similar to business organizations. Today, students from over a thousand schools and universities are already using our product. Koding for Teams will continue to amplify intra-school student learning, interactions and productivity, especially for STEM courses.

The cloud-based development environment has dramatically shifted how software engineers write code and collaborate. The cloud provides an immersive environment that increases productivity without requiring any installation. Already, we have over a million software developers using Koding who, in aggregate, have written over a billion lines of code, spun up millions of virtual machines and consumed over eight petabytes of storage. Our recently forged partnerships with developer focused companies like DigitalOcean and Amazon Web Services (AWS) help get Koding into the hands of even more developers worldwide.

We're so thankful to the incredible people who've worked with us so far to make Koding a success, especially the Koding community, our team, families, friends, investors and advisors. Through your feedback and comments, you've inspired us, kept us on track and driven us to every day to do more than we thought possible. We would not be here if it were not for you.

As we move forward, we plan to continue product development and expand our marketing and sales teams. [Join us][8] if you're interested in making software development easier, efficient and more effective.
