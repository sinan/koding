Last year, over [60,000 developers][2] from around the world hacked together virtually and won over $35,000 in cash prizes. The event was successful beyond our wildest dreams. We still periodically review the [amazing Twitter stream][3] that came together during the hackathon. It always puts a smile on our face. :)

**Thank you** for helping make our last hackathon such a success.

Today, in partnership with IBM, we are excited to announce the second Global Virtual Hackathon. This time the event is going to be even bigger than last year; for starters, contestants will be able to **win up to $150,000 in cash** **prizes**! The hackathon will happen on Feb 20-21. Slots are extremely limited, so [apply today][4]!

The event this year could not have been possible without the generous sponsorship from IBM. In addition to sponsoring the cash prize, IBM is also offering extended access to its Bluemix product for hackathon participants. Apply now to find out more! The following companies are also sponsoring this years hackathon: [Packet.net][5], [Hired][6], [Redis][7], [Gigster][8], [Datadog][9], [fwd.us][10], [Tokbox][11], and [Codementor][12]. We're ever so grateful to them for their support.  

**Let's hack together againâ€¦ wherever you are!**
